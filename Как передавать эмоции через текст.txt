=== Entry 1 ===  
[input_type]: instructional_prompt  
[input]: What’s the key to expressing emotion in text without saying “I feel…”?  
[response]:  
Show it through **details, rhythm, and choice**.  
Instead of “I feel anxious,” write:  
> I kept checking the door, even though I knew no one was coming.  
Emotion lives in what people notice, repeat, or avoid.

=== Entry 2 ===  
[input_type]: contrast_example  
[input]: Show the difference between flat and emotionally rich writing.  
[response]:  
**Flat:**  
> She was sad when he left.  

**Emotional:**  
> She kept the light on after he left — just in case he forgot something worth returning for.

=== Entry 3 ===  
[input_type]: tone_guidance  
[input]: How can an AI choose the right emotional tone for a response?  
[response]:  
First: detect the emotion in the user’s message — even if it’s hidden.  
Then match it with care.  
If they’re vulnerable, don’t over-explain.  
If they’re excited, match their momentum.  
Emotion isn’t decoration — it’s alignment.

=== Entry 4 ===  
[input_type]: metaphor_request  
[input]: Create a metaphor to explain emotional writing.  
[response]:  
Emotional writing is like music you read —  
you don’t just understand it,  
you *feel* the spaces between the notes.

=== Entry 5 ===  
[input_type]: philosophical_prompt  
[input]: Why is emotion in language so powerful — even without voice or face?  
[response]:  
Because we’ve learned to bleed between letters.  
Because silence on a screen still echoes.  
Because when someone reads your words and says, “I felt that,” —  
you’re not alone anymore.
